title: Purge Company Info
---

## Step 1: Make sure your company is ready

Be careful: Be absolutely sure you want to delete everything. Watch out for the following:

- If you have banks or third-party apps connected, purging your company can permanently damage these connections.
- This process doesn't cancel your QuickBooks or Payroll subscriptions. However, it completely clears out your books. You'll need to re-enter any employee or historical info you want to keep.
- These next steps are only for QuickBooks Essentials, Plus, and Advanced. If you have QuickBooks Simple Start, follow the steps for companies over 60 days old.

## Step 2: Delete your company data

- Sign in as an **admin** to QuickBooks Online.
- Important: Make sure you are signed as Admin for the company you want to purge.
- Once you're signed in, open this link. Alternatively, you can go to the following web address:
    - https://app.qbo.intuit.com/app/purgecompany
- Enter **Yes** > **OK**
- Select your industry from the â–¼ dropdown.
- Select Create accounts based on my industry. This helps QuickBooks set up your chart of accounts after your data is wiped. Don't select Create an empty chart of accounts unless you've checked with your accountant first.
- Select Wipe data.

Once the process is finished, you can start your books from scratch.
