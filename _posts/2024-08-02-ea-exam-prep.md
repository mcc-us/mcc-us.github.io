# Free Resources for EA Exam Preparation

Finding a comprehensive, free guide specifically for the Enrolled Agent (EA) exam is challenging, as most detailed and structured study materials are paid. However, there are some resources that can help you prepare for the EA exam at no cost. Here’s how you can create a free study plan:

## Free Resources for EA Exam Preparation

### 4. YouTube Channels and Free Online Courses
Some educators and tax professionals offer free video courses and tutorials on YouTube that cover EA exam topics. While not as structured as paid courses, these can be very helpful.

Search for channels like “Tax School,” “EA Exam Review,” or specific topics related to the EA exam.

### 7. Library Access
Check if your local library has access to tax law textbooks or subscriptions to online learning platforms that might offer EA exam preparation materials.

## Tips for Using Free Resources

- **Combine Resources**: Since a single free guide may not be available, combine these resources to cover all topics.
- **Create a Study Plan**: Structure your study time and materials as you would with a paid course, focusing on one part of the exam at a time.
- **Practice Regularly**: Use free practice questions and IRS publications to test your knowledge frequently.

By utilizing these free resources, you can effectively prepare for the EA exam without investing in paid materials.
