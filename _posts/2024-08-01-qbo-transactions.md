## Some COA Best Practices

- Always make sure each bank account is it's own account.  
  - Same with Credit cards, don't lump bank accounts and CCs into the same account.  

- QB will make you keep some accounts, you don't have to use them though!
   
- Any 'uncategorized" account should end in "99" and not be used over a long period of time. Just use it while you investigate the transaction.

- Don't use the main account whenever there are subaccounts as options. For example, don't code anything to "4000" when the transaction should go to subaccount 4010.

- If there is no suitable account for a given transaction, feel free to add one if you think it makes sense to have the presentation on the P&L. 

- Don't go too far overboard with a new account for every single transaction - try not to go more than 2 levels deep on your sub accounts 

- Avoid setting up accounts for vendors as vendors can be tagged separately for each line item. For example, don't make "quickbooks" its own account. Instead put "quickbooks" into a "software" category 

- Match Sales and COGS by product line when you can

- Customize this for your best use! 


## General Code: 
(Your mileage may vary.)

 1000s = Assets
 2000s = Liabilities  
 3000s = Equity
 4000s = Revenue
 5000s = Cost of Goods Sold
 6000s = Payroll  
 7000s = All other Expenses  
 8000s = Taxes and Misc
